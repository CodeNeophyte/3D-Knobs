The code works. But, IB Designables fails to render in Interface Builder. If anyone knows how to fix that, any hints or Pull Requests would be appreciated. Thanks!

(2) Clicking on the ImageKnob in IB, add the *image name* you want and *total number of frames* for that knob. Then, you're good to go.
